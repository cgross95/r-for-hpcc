## Prerequisites

To participate in this workshop, we assume:

  - You have an account through ICER to access the HPCC.
  - You have some experience using R.
  - You have some experience using the Linux, the HPCC, and SLURM (e.g., you have taken ICER's Introduction to the HPCC workshop)

## Software Setup

This workshop requires no software, only the use of ICER's [OnDemand service](https://ondemand.hpcc.msu.edu).

However, you may optionally like to use an SSH client on your computer to access the HPCC through the command line.
For instructions on installing an SSH client on Windows, Mac, and Linux, please see [ICER's documentation](https://docs.icer.msu.edu/install_ssh_client/).
