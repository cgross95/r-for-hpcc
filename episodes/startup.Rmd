:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can you change the way that R works on the HPCC?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Demonstrate how to change the commands run in an R session with the `.Rprofile` file
- Demonstrate how to set important environment variables in the `.Renviron` file

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown][pandoc] for static files (with extension `.md`) and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output
(with extension `.Rmd`). Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries
Workbench][carpentries-workbench] for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a valid
Carpentries lesson template:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

```r
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can include figures generated from R Markdown:

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```
Or you can use pandoc markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Add functions and set options in the `.Rprofile` file to customize your R session
- Set the `R_LIBS_USER` environment variable in the `.Renviron` file to change where R looks for and installs libraries
- Use the `--vanilla` flag to ignore your customizations
