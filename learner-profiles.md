title: Learner profiles
---

This workshop is oriented toward researchers who are using (or thinking of using) R code and are having trouble running it on a personal computer.
Their code may require a lot of memory or take too long to run.

Learners may be used to using RStudio to write and run code, but may not be as familiar with using the command line.
